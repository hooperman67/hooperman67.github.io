With fluffy flower spikes in shades of red, pink or white, astilbes put on an impressive summer show. They also provide winter interest if the seedheads are left in place. There is a wide choice, from large flamboyant specimens for spacious borders to compact cultivars for containers, and everything in between. Astilbes are all fully hardy and thrive in damp, shady locations, bog gardens and pondsides.

These vigorous plants don’t grow well in very poor soil. They also dislike dry conditions, even in summer. The leaves may scorch in hot sunny weather, so position them where they’ll get some midday shade.

Among the best of all foliage plants (summer flowers are a bonus), hostas vary from large plants to more diminutive types that are suitable for rock gardens. All thrive in shade and make good container plants.

They have a reputation for being loved by slugs and snails, so choose your hosta carefully to minimise the holes or consider controlling these pests.

These shade-loving plants are primarily grown for their beautiful foliage.
There's a vast range of cultivars to choose from, with leaves in all shades of green, as well as dusky blues and acid yellows, sometimes variegated or flashed with cream or gold, ruffled, smooth or distinctively ribbed. Many also produce small trumpet-shaped mauve or white flowers in summer.
Hostas are notoriously irresistible to slugs and snails, but are also much loved by gardeners, who often amass large collections.

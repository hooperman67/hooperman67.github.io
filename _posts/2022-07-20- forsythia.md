Forsythias are renowned for their vibrant yellow flowers, which appear in early spring all along the bare branches, largely before the leaves unfurl. They usually form large, upright shrubs with arching stems and are deciduous, so lose their leaves over winter.

<strong>Cultivation</strong>

Grow in well-drained soil in a sheltered position in sun or partial shade

<strong>Propagation</strong>

- Take 

Softwood cuttings are taken from spring to early summer (Apr-Jun), using material from the soft and flexible young shoot tips from this seasons growth, which root readily. Use for hardy and tender perennials, deciduous shrubs, climbers and some trees.

Pots are plastic, metal, ceramic (incl. terracotta) or biodegradable containers with drainage holes in their base. They range in diameter typically from 5-90cm (2in-3ft), but 7.5-15cm (3-5in) are most commonly used for growing on plants and sowing seeds (although seed trays and seed pans (short pots) are also used for seed).

- Take 

Semi ripe cuttings are taken from summer to mid-autumn (Jul-Sep) from healthy stems grown this season. The base of the cutting is firm, while the tip is still soft.

Hardwood cuttings are taken from mid-autumn until late winter from vigorous healthy shoots of the current year's growth - this will be woody but pliable.

<strong>Suggested planting locations and garden types</strong>

- Hedging
- Borders
- Wall side borders

<strong>Pruning</strong>

Prune in mid-spring, immediately after flowering – avoid pruning later in the year, as the following spring’s flowers will be reduced.

 Annual pruning keeps plants healthy, shapely and within bounds:
 
-  Cut back flowered growth to vigorous upward- and outward-facing shoots lower down

- Also remove up to one-fifth of the oldest stems from the base of the plant. This will encourage strong new shoots to sprout from the base

- Thin out any crowded shoots in the centre of the bush and remove any weak growth 

<strong>Diseases</strong>

Forsythias are robust, hardy and usually trouble-free shrubs.

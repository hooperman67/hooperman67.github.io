# When to prune

Climbers are routinely pruned in winter, after the flowers have faded, between December and February.

Long whippy shoots can be shortened or tied in during autumn, to prevent strong winds from damaging them.

Renovation can be carried out at any time between late autumn and late winter.

It is easier to see what you are doing when the rose is not in leaf, plus there is a better response from the rose, which should grow back vigorously the following spring.

Climbing roses are not self-clinging and need supports of trellis or horizontal wires to which the shoots can be tied. 

-  Set the lowest wire 45cm (18in) off the ground and space subsequent wires 30cm (1ft) apart

- If training roses up pillars, arches or pergolas, twist the main shoots gently around the uprights, keeping them as horizontal as possible, to encourage flowering shoots to form low down

- If the main stems are slow to branch, tip-prune them to the first strong bud to encourage side shoots, otherwise leave them to fill the available space
- 
- Remove dead, damaged, diseased or spindly growth, and deadhead during the flowering season to encourage further flowering

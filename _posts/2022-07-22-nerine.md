Great for adding a splash of late colour to sun-baked borders and containers in autumn, these bulbs produce dainty flowers in particularly vivid shades of pink, as well as bright white and rich red.

They like a really hot, dry spot, and most species aren’t reliably hardy, so it’s advisable to bring them indoors over winter in most parts of the UK.

# Division
Lift congested clumps in early summer and divide into smaller sections and replant.

Itâ€™s a joy to see the garden wake up after winter. The highlights are spring bulbs, tree blossom and flowering shrubs.
Spring is also the busiest time in the garden, so try to get ahead before the weeds start growing.

This is the time to sow seeds, indoors and outside, and to make weeding a priority.

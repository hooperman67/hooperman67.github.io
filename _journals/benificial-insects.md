Beneficial insects are essential in keeping our gardens and farms healthy.
Some pollinate plants that produce our food. Others eat pests that would otherwise destroy our food crops. They also help break down dead organic material and recycle nutrients back into the soil.
We rely on these tiny insects more than we realize, and they are a valuable part of the ecosystem.


# Hoverflies
Often confused with wasps because of their similar yellow and black colouring. However, unlike wasps, hoverflies do not sting (nor do they have long antennae, angry eyes and a bulgy abdomen with a wasp waist – that’s how you tell the difference). More than 85 species have been found in a single garden. They can fly in bursts of up to 40km per hour. The adult hoverfly feeds on nectar and pollen, and their larvae are voracious predators of aphids and other garden pests. As a result, hoverflies should be welcome in any organic growing area, acting both as pollinators and pest controllers. How do you tell the sex of a hoverfly? It’s all in the eyes - the male's eyes meet at the top of the head, whereas the female's are separated by a gap.

> Plants to attract hoverflies: yarrow, alyssum, dill, cosmos, mallow, poached egg plant, lemon balm, potentilla, marigold

# Ladybirds (Coleoptera)

These beetles are carnivores, feeding almost exclusively on aphids (green and black fly) and red spider mites. Which is why the organic grower loves them. Ladybirds lay hundreds of eggs in the colonies of aphids and other plant-eating pests. When they hatch, the ladybird larvae will eat up to 5,000 aphids. A ladybird can only live up to 3 years – assuming it can dodge its predators, which it does by exuding a toxic yellow substance (reflex blood). Interestingly swifts and swallows are immune to these defensive chemicals. The ladybird’s distinctive shell is often red or orange, and the number of spots can vary from 2 to 18.

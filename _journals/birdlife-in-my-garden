Our gardens are a haven for wildlife throughout the year. In winter, a variety of bird species are attracted to feeders and bird tables and can be watched from the comfort of our own homes.
During the spring and summer, as well as availing of the food you put out, many birds will nest in nestboxes, trees, shrubs and even garden sheds.
